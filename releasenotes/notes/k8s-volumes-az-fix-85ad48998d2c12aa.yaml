    In a multi availability zone (AZ) environment, if Nova doesn't support
    cross AZ volume mount, then the cluster creation may fail because Nova can
    not mount volume in different AZ. This issue only impact Fedora Atomic and
    Fedora CoreOS drivers. Now this issue is fixed by passing in the AZ info
    when creating volumes.
